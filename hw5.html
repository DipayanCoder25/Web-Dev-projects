		<h3>How played?</h3>
		<em>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game that is played between two teams of eleven players on a field, at the centre of which is a <mark>22-yard (20-metre; 66-foot) pitch </mark> with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails (small sticks) balanced on three stumps</em><br>. Two players from the batting team, the striker and nonstriker, stand in front of either wicket holding bats, while one player from the fielding team, the bowler, bowls the ball toward the striker's wicket from the opposite end of the pitch<br>

		<h1>History</h1>
		<p>Cricket is one of many games in the "club ball" sphere that involve hitting a ball with a hand-held implement. Others include baseball (which shares many similarities with cricket, both belonging in the more specific bat-and-ball games category[6]), golf, hockey, tennis, squash, badminton and table tennis.[7] In cricket's case, a key difference is the existence of a solid target structure, the wicket (originally, it is thought, a "wicket gate" through which sheep were herded), that the batter must defend.[8] The cricket historian Harry Altham identified three "groups" of "club ball" games: the "hockey group", in which the ball is driven to and from between two targets (the goals); the "golf group", in which the ball is driven towards an undefended target (the hole); and the "cricket group", in which "the ball is aimed at a mark (the wicket) and driven away from it"
